# cy-dom-diff

`cy-dom-diff` allows matching chunks of DOM against HTML; including dynamic content.

## Introduction

`cy-dom-diff` consist of two parts.  First is a Cypress command that matches a DOM element against a regular expression.  When a DOM element is matched its HTML is normalized to produce consistent diffable output while maintaining sematic meaning.  This includes:

* whitespace and newlines are normalized
* tags and attributes are printed on individual lines
* comments are removed
* tags and attributes can be ignored through configuration

In the second part `cy-dom-diff` provides a template function to generate a regular expression from a HTML string.  This HTML string is passed through the same normalization as the DOM element (described above) as well as allowing embedded regular expression for dynamic content.

## Installation and Setup

```sh
npm install --save-dev @swimlane/cy-dom-diff
```

Import the Cypress commands in `cypress/support/index.js` or `cypress/support/commands.js`

```js
import '@swimlane/cy-dom-diff/commands';
```

## Usage

In a basic example the following will assert that the element matches the regexp generated by the `dom` template tag.  Most of the HTML string within the tagged template string is treated literally.  However, regular expressions within the embedded expression are matches as expected.

```js
import { dom } from '@swimlane/cy-dom-diff';

const TIME = /\d?\d:\d?\d\:\d?\d/;
const NUMBER = /[\+\-]?\d*\.?\d+(?:[Ee][\+\-]?\d+)?/;

cy.get('#clock').domMatch(dom`
    <span>The current time is:</span>
    <span class="clock">${TIME} ${/[AP]/}M</span>
    <span class="offset">${NUMBER}</span> hrs
  `);
```

### `cy.domMatch` Cypress command

`cy.domMatch` will run the `domMatch` assertions (see below) and add a Cypress runner log with a diff.

### `cy.domDiff` Cypress command

`cy.domDiff` is used in the same way as `cy.domMatch` but will only add a Cypress runner log with a diff.  It will not fail if the DOM does not match and will not retry.

### `domMatch` Chai assertion

At its lowest level `cy-dom-diff` adds a Chai assertion for matching the DOM.  This will not generate a Cypress log except to show that the assertion passed or failed.  Use `cy.domMatch` to get better logging.

```js
import { dom } from '@swimlane/cy-dom-diff';

const TIME = /\d?\d:\d?\d\:\d?\d/;
const NUMBER = /[\+\-]?\d*\.?\d+(?:[Ee][\+\-]?\d+)?/;

cy.get('#clock').should('domMatch', dom`
  <span>The current time is:</span>
  <span class="clock">${TIME} ${/[AP]/}M</span>
  <span class="offset">${NUMBER}</span> hrs
`);

// OR

cy.get('#clock').then($el => {
  expect($el).to.domMatch(dom`
    <span>The current time is:</span>
    <span class="clock">${TIME} ${/[AP]/}M</span>
    <span class="offset">${NUMBER}</span> hrs
  `);
});
```
